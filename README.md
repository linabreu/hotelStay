# hotelStay
Program created to utilize decision logic. Calculates the cost of a hotel stay based on the user's loyalty status and length of stay


How It Works:

The user will enter thier loyalty status (Gold, Platinum, or None) and their length of stay (whole numbers only).
The base room charge is a fixed $175.00 per room per night. The customer receives a discount on the final bill based on thier loyalty status which is as follows:
Gold member:  2 - 5 nights, 15% discount; more than 5 nights, 25% discount
Platinum member:  2 - 5 nights, 25% discount; more than 5 nights, 40% discount


Program calculates the final bill not including sales tax and displays the users's member status, the applied discount % and discount dollar value, and the final bill.
